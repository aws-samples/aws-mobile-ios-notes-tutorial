# iOS Notes App

# Description

A starting point iOS Swift app to demonstrate best practices for a well-written local storage only app. This app will be used as a base and we&#39;ll build it up to a full-fledge &quot;cloudify&quot; notes app.

## Get Started

[Read the tutorial](./tutorial/index.md)

## Features

This notes app allows a user to **add** , **update** , and **delete notes** that are stored locally (offline) on the device.

The main (master) screen allows a user to add and delete notes. Selecting a note from the main view will display and allow the user to edit the note title and content inline.

## Structure

The starter **MyNotes** app is a Universal master-detail iOS layout and uses Core Data Model for persistence of each note on the local device.

For simplicity, this notes app only uses built-in iOS features and does not contain any third-party libraries or external dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Xcode 8+

Swift 3

iOS 10.0 or greater
